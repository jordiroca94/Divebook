## Stack

Diverbook is a full-stack website built with Next.js and TypeScript, styled with Tailwind CSS. The back-end is implemented using MongoDB, Node.js & a REST API. The login system is managed with NextAuth, and images are stored in Edgestore.

## What is about?

The aim of this website is to share your diving experiences with other divers around the world. You can register to post your diving experiences, as well as comment on and rate the dives of other users. Non-registered users can navigate the website, but only registered users can create and edit diving experiences and rate other users' dives.
